Getanicki is powered by an army of nickis, orbiting neighborhoods near and far in service of our nicki network (you!). In their travels, when they come across unique local businesses, they just can't keep quiet about it, and often put the word out to the network that they've come across something cool that must be tried.  Better yet, they\\u2019ll even offer to bring it to you! This is called a nicki popup, and it's going to expand your world There isn't a task you can imagine that nicki can't help you out with, and a day of your life that nicki can't help you improve.
